# alx_travel_app_0x03

This project is a continuation of `alx_travel_app_0x00`, focused on implementing API development for listings and bookings using Django REST Framework.

## ðŸ§© Features

- Full CRUD API for Listings and Bookings  
- RESTful endpoints with DRF's `ModelViewSet`  
- URL routing via DRF's `DefaultRouter`  
- Swagger/OpenAPI schema generation and docs  
- Celery integration for background tasks (e.g., booking email notifications)  
- Tested with Postman

- Django REST Framework  
- Celery (with RabbitMQ as the broker)  
- drf-yasg (Swagger for API docs)  
- Requests (for payment gateway integration)  

## ðŸ§ª Testing

- Test the endpoints using Postman/Swagger  
- Confirm payment initiation and verification  
- Verify that Celery background tasks (email notifications) run correctly

## ðŸ“Œ Task Requirements

**Objective**  
Deploy the application to a server and ensure Swagger documentation is publicly accessible.  

**Instructions**  

1. **Deploy Application**  
   - Deploy the application to a cloud server (e.g., Render, PythonAnywhere â€“ recommended).  
   - Ensure all necessary environment variables are configured correctly on the server.  

2. **Run Celery Worker on Server**  
   - Configure Celery to run with RabbitMQ.  
   - Verify that background tasks work as expected in the live environment.  

3. **Configure Swagger**  
   - Ensure that Swagger documentation is accessible publicly at `/swagger/` on the deployed server.  

4. **Test Deployed Application**  
   - Test all endpoints, including the email notification feature, to confirm they function correctly in production.
